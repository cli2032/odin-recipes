    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Here's a homemade ranch dressing recipe courtesy of J. Kenji Lopez-Alt. It's a very solid recipe and well worth making
        rather than buying premade ranch dressing from the store. It's also nice because after you make it once or twice you
        can quickly get a feel for the proportions of the ingredients needed and simply eyeball things in the future.
