    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Here's an amazing pasta salad recipe from Ethan Chlebowski. Despite the fact that I call it a recipe, it's much more
        a loose framework rather than a strict recipe - pasta salads are so versatile that you can add in, substitute, or remove
        many of the things in this ingredient list to your liking and it will still not only be delicious, but nutritionally
        well-balanced and easy to prepare. Make it as shown once or twice, then start adding your own twist on it!
